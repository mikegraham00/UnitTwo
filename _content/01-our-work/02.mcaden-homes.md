  	  Based in Austin, McAden Builders is a premier builder of luxury custom homes and commercial properties. We completed a major website overhaul in early 2014.

  <p>
  	  McAden's previous site was Flash-based. This meant that users who tried to visit the site on non-Flash browsers or devices such as iPhones or iPads could not access the site content at all. Our complete site rebuild fixed that and more. Visually, the new site reflects the rustic yet sophisticated and modern Hill Country style that defines much of McAden's work. We built the site using responsive techniques, ensuring the site looks and works flawlessly on all devices and all screen sizes. Our custom WordPress theme allows them to easily update their content and constantly add new items to their ever-growing portfolio.
  </p>
  <p>
  	 The final result is they have a beautiful site which properly showcases their stunning work and unique building expertise.
