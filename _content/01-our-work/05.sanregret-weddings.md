  	    Weddings should ber beautiful and memorable events, and Jen makes her client's weddings more beautiful and memorable than most. This acclaimed wedding planner needed a website that conveyed her impeccable design sense and showcased her incredible work. We were able to accomplish both with a custom WordPress theme.
  </p>
  <p>
  	The site looks and works great on all devices and screen sizes, plus she is able to easily add items to her portfolio and post to her blog. We are in the process of expanding the site to highlight some of her exciting new services.
