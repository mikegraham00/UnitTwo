  <p>
  	    Westlake Plastic Surgery's site needed a facelift..so to speak. We created a responsive design that was attractive, clean, and simple in order to let Dr. Caridi's expertise and exceptional work stand out. <span style="background-color: initial;">We were able to use WordPress to reorganize and reshape their already extensive content library to make it easier for potential patients to navigate.</span><span style="background-color: initial;"></span><span style="background-color: initial;"> </span>
  </p>
  <p>
  	 <span style="background-color: initial;">Our redesign has helped dramatically increase the number of leads that Westlake receives via their site. We have continued to refine and expand the site to highlight information that patients find most helpful.</span>
