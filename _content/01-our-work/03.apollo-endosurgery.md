  	  This site was a unique challenge which we were excited to take on. Their previous site was built on a custom CMS which made content edits difficult and design changes totally impossible. We worked with their internal marketing team to reorganize the site content highlighting their cutting-edge products and the procedures that surgeons perform with those products. We then built a responsive WordPress theme which allows them to easily manage and update their content, including articles, text, photos and videos. Less than an hour of training allowed us to hand off the day-to-day management of the site to their team.
